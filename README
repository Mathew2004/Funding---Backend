# Admin Authentication System with JWT

This is a simple Node.js application that allows an admin to sign up and log in using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The application uses MongoDB Atlas for database storage, `bcryptjs` for password hashing, and `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying JWT tokens.

## Features

- **Admin Signup**: Allows new admins to register by providing an email and password.
- **Admin Login**: Authenticates admins by verifying their email and password, and returns a JWT token.
- **JWT Authentication**: Tokens are generated during login and can be used for secure access to protected routes.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before storing them in the database for security.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
- dotenv (for managing environment variables)

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js installed (preferably the latest LTS version).
2. MongoDB Atlas account and a cluster created (you can create a free cluster).
3. Basic knowledge of how JWT works.
